# Unofficial Amazing Radio Plugin For XBMC

This is a very, very basic plugin for XBMC that allows you to listen to live streams from Amazing Radio & Amazing Ambient.  

So far it has been tested under Mac OSX & on my Raspberry Pi.

## Installation Instructions

Simply download the latest zip file from the [downloads](downloads/) page.  On XBMC, go to System->Addons->Install from zip file & locate your downloaded zip file.

You can alternatively clone this repository & run the even more basic build script (by typing `sh build.sh` on a terminal) to generate the zip package, if you know what that means & have a UNIX compatible environment.

## TODO

* Add Amazing Rewind streams
* Add timeshifted streaming

## Contributing

To all you developers out there, feel free to chip into this addon if you find any fixes or improvements - I didn't choose GitHub just because I'm a fan of git!
